## Chapter 1 learning C++

I have already dabbled with C++ on very basic problems and am excited to learn more. 

So far everything is very familiar or linkable to other languages:

- its very like old school JS as in we must declare functions before there use - no hoisting here!
- we have a main! like rust, python etc
- syntax very similar to JS again wants them semi colons!

Difference:

- automatic return of 0 when undefined
- debugger lets you see the registers! and CPU pretty cool

Printing out like rust uses format specifiers:
